I’m a self-taught programmer with 4 years of non-commercial experience, with a huge passion for low-level code, optimizations, science, trading and graphics. <br/>

I’m very curious - always open to learning something new. Like to solve complex tasks. Able to write compact and performant code in different languages and design app architecture. <br/>

While i'm prefer to use C# In my projects, I also know C and modern C++. Sometimes I use Python for simple tasks. I also write shaders using GLSL and HLSL (Unity). <br/>

I've been using Linux for about a year. This forces me to write cross-platform code. Familiar with X libraries - XInput and XRandr. I used them for better system integration in one of my projects. <br/>
