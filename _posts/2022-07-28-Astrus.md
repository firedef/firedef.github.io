{: .notice--info}
This page is incomlete. There are a lot of stuff from current project and previous versions. I will add soon(*when*?) planet and galaxy generation info here. Old versions have some minimal gameplay, so i will add screenshots too.

This game by now is more a concept than an actual game. There are a **LOT** of work to do

# Astrus
Astrus is a 2D strategy game about space. Basically this is my dream game. The game was inspired by [Stellaris][Stellaris], [Reassembly] and [Wikipedia][Wikipedia].

The main idea of the game is to make it's moddable, performant, beautiful and to add lot's of scientific (and fictional) concepts without making it boring or inconvenient.

To develop game i'm using C# and Unity. I planned to using my custom [game engine][Quartz], but it's really hard even to achive stuff i already have.

# Nebulae
One of my greatest shaders i ever made - nebulae shader for this game. It's based on noise from [here][IqNoise] and examples from [here][TheBookOfShadersNoise].

There are lot's of pressets, but one shader. To achive depth i used 3D world space coordinates, 2D lighting with normal maps and up to 9 curved on z-axis circles. However, the shader is heavy (multiple 3D FBM noise samples, up to 9 samples per pixel (multiple meshes)).
